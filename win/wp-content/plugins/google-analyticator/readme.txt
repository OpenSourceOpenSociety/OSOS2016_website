* Prepares Google Analyticator for WordPress 3.0 compatibility.

If you use custom tracking code, be sure to migrate that code to the new async tracking methods.
* Removes settings made obsolete due to the new async tracking (footer tracking and http/https).
* Fixes the (not set) pages in the Top Pages section of the dashboard widget. Pages containing the title (not set) will be combined with the correct page and corresponding title.
