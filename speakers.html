                Dave Lane is President of the NZ Open Source Society, and an advocate of
                Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) adoption in business, education and
                government. He works for Catalyst IT, which in 2012 acquired Egressive,
                the FOSS company he founded in 1998.

                Among many other interests, he is passionate about his adopted home, NZ,
                and would love to see the government and education become far more open
                for the inherent social, economic, and pedagogical advantages openness
                offers. He goes to great lengths to use FOSS exclusively himself, he's a
                fan of anyone who knows what "Commons-based peer production" and
                "permissionless innovation" are, and he has been advocating for "open"
                since long before it was cool.

              <p>
                Josh fell into the web at the raw age of 16, building websites for all his long-haired friends who played loud music.
                Since then, Josh has applied his astounding capacity to making music of his own, studying design at Massey Uni (which went ok - he spent 6 months teaching there too), before scooting off to London to exhibit his final-year project for Neville Brody’s Anti-Design Festival.
                Josh still found time to work at a leading branding agency, shaping such projects as in-flight entertainment systems for airlines like Air New Zealand and Cathay Pacific. You might’ve heard of them. Picking up 2 BeST Awards for Typography in 2009 and running an environmentally sustainable manufacturing business on the side helped to keep him entertained on ‘slow’ days.
                Naturally, with all that going on, Josh has a bit of spare time. He plays guitar, bass and keyboards, and has his own home studio to prove it. He also lists running UP hills and planning weddings as his hobbies. Nobody’s perfect.

                Vik Olliver is a longhair Open enthusiast who does actually make a living out of Open hardware. He is best know for his work in the RepRap 3D printer core team but enjoys diddling with all manner of Open projects, from Alcohol to Zeroemission transport.
                </p>

                <p>
                He spends a lot of his time expounding the virtues of Open to the world, and encouraging local groups to collaborate in an ethical manner. He has a Green philosophy but eats meat and doesn't do any of the airyfairy crystal wavey stuff.

                <p>
                With his wife Suz, daughters Tamara and Kate, and a few lesser mortals he runs a factory and open workshop in Henderson. This notionally produces Open 3D printers and printer filament, but in practice gets used as a brewery, metal foundry, CNC emporium, hydroponic garden and zombie apocalypse refuge. Delegates are welcome to drop by.

                <p>

                  Lillian Grace brings a new perspective on data, one where data is a language in which everyone can be fluent. She believes societies and individuals will benefit when anyone can use data to inform their thinking and insights without requiring intermediaries.

                  Lillian is the CEO and Founder of Wiki New Zealand, the first organisation to designate everyone as a user of data and to build systems and software to deliver to this standard. Wiki New Zealand puts data in simple charts using consistent standards so that people can easily play with and explore data. Critical to this solution was the development of Grace, a backend application that can extract data from a variety of formats and apply a transparent standardisation process that results in the data being consistent, clean and easy to find and use.

                  Collaboration is central to Wiki New Zealand, and Lillian believes the most comprehensive collection of data about New Zealand will only come from working together with domain and data experts. Lillian engages with those in Government, private sector, academia, media, schools, and the general public to involve them in the effort and inform the evolution of Wiki New Zealand and its offerings.
