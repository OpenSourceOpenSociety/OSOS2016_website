                  Dave Lane is President of the NZ Open Source Society, and an advocate of
                  Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) adoption in business, education and
                  government. </p><p>He works for Catalyst IT, which in 2012 acquired Egressive,
                  the FOSS company he founded in 1998.</p><p>

                  Among many other interests, he is passionate about his adopted home, NZ,
                  and would love to see the government and education become far more open
                  for the inherent social, economic, and pedagogical advantages openness
                  offers. </p><p>He goes to great lengths to use FOSS exclusively himself, he's a
                  fan of anyone who knows what "Commons-based peer production" and
                  "permissionless innovation" are, and he has been advocating for "open"
                  since long before it was cool.

                  <p>
                    Josh fell into the web at the raw age of 16, building websites for all his long-haired friends who played loud music.</p><p>
                    Since then, Josh has applied his astounding capacity to making music of his own, studying design at Massey Uni (which went ok - he spent 6 months teaching there too), before scooting off to London to exhibit his final-year project for Neville Brody’s Anti-Design Festival.</p><p>
                    Josh still found time to work at a leading branding agency, shaping such projects as in-flight entertainment systems for airlines like Air New Zealand and Cathay Pacific. You might’ve heard of them. </p><p>Picking up 2 BeST Awards for Typography in 2009 and running an environmentally sustainable manufacturing business on the side helped to keep him entertained on ‘slow’ days.</p><p>
                    Naturally, with all that going on, Josh has a bit of spare time. He plays guitar, bass and keyboards, and has his own home studio to prove it. He also lists running UP hills and planning weddings as his hobbies. Nobody’s perfect.

                        Lillian Grace brings a new perspective on data, one where data is a language in which everyone can be fluent. </p><p>She believes societies and individuals will benefit when anyone can use data to inform their thinking and insights without requiring intermediaries.</p><p>

Critical to this solution was the development of Grace, a backend application that can extract data from a variety of formats and apply a transparent standardisation process that results in the data being consistent, clean and easy to find and use.</p><p>

                        Collaboration is central to Wiki New Zealand, and Lillian believes the most comprehensive collection of data about New Zealand will only come from working together with domain and data experts. </p><p>Lillian engages with those in Government, private sector, academia, media, schools, and the general public to involve them in the effort and inform the evolution of Wiki New Zealand and its offerings.
